## `@tsly/maybe`

This package publishes utilities for working with any nullish values. It's method are designed to be chainable and were inspired by [kotlin-style scope functions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/scope-functions.html).

### The `maybe` Function

```ts
import { maybe } from "@tsly/maybe";
```

The `maybe` function is the factory for the underlying `Maybe<T>` class, however the `maybe()` function has some important typings.

This package largely relies upon [nullish/optional chaining](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-7.html). As such, calling `maybe` will return `null` for any nullish value, and `Maybe<T>` for any non-nullish value. This logic is recursive for any chainable method within the `Maybe<T>` class.

```ts
import { maybe } from "@tsly/maybe";

const value: string | undefined = // ...
const example = maybe(value);
//    ^? Maybe<string> | null
```

### Ancillary Exports

```ts
import { isSome } from "@tsly/maybe";
const arr = ['one', 'two', undefined, 'three', null];

console.log(arr.filter(isSome)); // ['one', 'two', 'three'];
```

```ts
import { isNone } from "@tsly/maybe";
const value: string | undefined = // ...

if (isNone(value)) {
    return;
}

value // <-- now typed as `string`
```

```ts
// idiomatic counterpart to the `NonNullable` builtin
import { type Nullable } from "@tsly/maybe";

type Wrapped = Nullable<string>; // string | null
type Unwrapped = NonNullable<MyType>; // string
```
