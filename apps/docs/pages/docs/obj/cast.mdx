# Cast

Returns the wrapped value, implicitly retyping it object without any restriction or overlap checks

<Callout type="warning">
  This method is fundementally unsafe. It should be used with great caution and
  only when typescript can't follow typechecking.
</Callout>

Often times, this use case crops up when object properies are being checked on an indexed value. In most cases this indexed object should simply be explicitly bound to a variable, but sitations where it cannot, `obj(/* ... */).cast(){:ts}` may be used.

```ts copy
import { obj } from "@tsly/obj";

type Shape2D = {
  /* ... */
};
type Shape3D = {
  /* ... */
};

type Shape = { type: "2d"; shape: Shape2D } | { type: "3d"; shape: Shape3D };

function print2dShape(shape: Shape2D) {
  /* ... */
}
function print3dShape(shape: Shape3D) {
  /* ... */
}

function printShapeRange(shapes: Shape[], lowerIdx: number, upperIdx: number) {
  if (shapes[lowerIdx].type == "2d") print2DShape(obj(shapes[lowerIdx]).cast());
  else print3DShape(obj(shapes[lowerIdx]).cast());

  if (lowerIdx < upperIdx) printShapeRange(shapes, lowerIdx + 1, upperIdx);
}
```
