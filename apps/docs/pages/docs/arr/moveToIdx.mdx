# moveToIdx

Moves the element at the `startIdx` to the specified `endIdx` without leaving any gaps. This behavior can be thought about as "drag 'n' drop" style, rather than something like [swapAt](/docs/arr/swapAt).

```ts copy codesandbox=tsly
import { arr } from "@tsly/arr";

const fruit = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "pear", "kiwi"];
console.log(arr(fruit).moveToIdx(1, 3).take());
// ["apple", "orange", "pear", "banana", "kiwi"]
```
